## Known issues

- [@gatsbyjs/gatsby#17506](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17506) Console warning about `lazy=load` images missing dimensions. This is a known issue in Gatsby and the [recommendation as of Sept, 2019](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17506#issuecomment-529904482) is to ignore it.
- Hard page loads with hashes donâ€™t start scrolled when developing locally (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/#docs-content`).
